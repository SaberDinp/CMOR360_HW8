Q2: See the graph.png file for a counter example! In this graph by selecting vertices 1 and 4, Ken will know all of the 5 people 0, ..., 4 because everybody are friends with these two people. But your solution says we should require to select at least one of two people 2 or 3 since there is an edge between the two of them. Your solution is a solution to the Min Vertex Cover problem which is very well-known but our problem is something slightly different.
